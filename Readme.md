# Quake 2 Smash the Targets

### How to Play
Go around the one map compatible (the first map in the multiplayer menu) with the mod and touch (smash) the targets while killing enemies and buying stat upgrades.

A default/reccomended configuration file is included in this repo, this sets class selection to f7, f8, and f9, as default.

### How to Install
Build the solution with visual studio and put the gamex86.dll from the debug folder into it's own mod folder in quake2's dir (copy baseq2 and replace the gamex86 dll + config file) and replace your quake2.exe with the one from the build folder.
